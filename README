-- Add bin/ to your path --

To make our executables runnable from anywhere, add our bin directory
to your path. Add a line like the following to the end of your
~/.bashrc file.

export PATH=$PATH:/home/andersm2/remotehome/research/practicum/matmult/bin

Replace the part following the : with the actual path to the bin/
directory in your file system share.  To get this to work the first
time either open a new terminal or run source ~/.bashrc
