<H3>OINK interface to the MapReduce-MPI Library 
</H3>
<P>OINK is a C++ application that provdes a hi-level scripting interface
to the MR-MPI library which it uses internally. These are three goals
of OINK:
</P>
<UL><LI>(1) To allow MapReduce algorithms which call the MR-MPI library to be
written with a minimum of extraneous code, to work with input/output
in various forms, and to be chained together and driven via a simple,
yet versatile scripting language. 

<LI>(2) To create an archive of map() and reduce() functions for re-use by
different algorithms. 

<LI>(3) To provide a scripted interface to the lo-level MR-MPI library
calls that can speed development/debugging of new algortihms before
coding them up in C++ or another language. 
</UL>
<P>OINK has its own <A HREF = "../oinkdoc/Manual.html">manual and doc pages</A>, so
further details are not given here.
