<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which computes a minimal independent set (MIS)
of vertices for an undirected graph.  A MIS contains vertices which do
not share an edge and to which no additional vertex can be added.  For
a given graph there are typically many possible MIS's; the MIS that is
computed is a function of the specified random number seed.  The MIS
is found by <A HREF = "#Luby">Luby's algorithm</A>, which is an interative method.
The MapReduce version of Luby's algorithm implemented by this command
is discussed in the paper of <A HREF = "#Plimpton">(Plimpton)</A>.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in which
the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  This means that either (Vi,Vj) or (Vj,Vi) appears, but
not both.  Also (Vi,Vi) does not appear.  The input is unchanged by
this command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the list of vertices in the MIS.
