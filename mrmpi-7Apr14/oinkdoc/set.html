<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command sets global settings which are used in the creation of
MR-MPI objects and the underlying MapReduce objects they wrap.  Note
that many of these setting names have the same meaning they do in the
MR-MPI library themselves, as discussed on <A HREF = "../doc/settings.html">this doc
page</A>.
</P>
<P>The settings for the <I>verbosity</I>, <I>timer</I>, <I>memsize</I>. <I>outofcore</I>,
<I>minpage</I>, <I>maxpage</I>, <I>freepage</I>, and <I>zeropage</I> keywords are used by
the <A HREF = "mr.html">mr</A> command creates a MapReduce object to set its
attributes.  Note that the <A HREF = "mr.html">mr</A> command itself can override
several of these global settings.
</P>
<P><A HREF = "command.html">Named commands</A> can also create MapReduce objects,
either when inputting and outputting data, or when the run() method in
the named command class invokes certain methods, like create_mr() or
copy_mr().  Each time a new MapReduce object is created, these same
global settings are applied to it.  See <A HREF = "Section_commands.html">this doc
page</A> for more discussion of the input/output
options and these methods.
</P>
<P>The <I>scratch</I> keyword is a directory pathname which all MapReduce
objects will use for writing temporary files when they operate in
out-of-core mode.  Every MapReduce object created by OINK will have
its scratch directory set to this value, via the fpath() call
described on <A HREF = "../doc/settings.html">this doc page</A>
</P>
<P>The <I>prepend</I> and <I>substitute</I> keywords affect how file and directory
names are interpreted by OINK.  File and directory names are used as
input and output options to <A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A> via the "-i"
and "-o" arguments in an input script.  Before these path names are
passed to the MR-MPI library, e.g. as part of a
<A HREF = "../doc/map.html">map()</A> method, they can have a directory name
prepended to them, and "%" characters in the path name substituted for
with a processor ID.  This is to enable flexible options for
input/output of different files by different processors.
</P>
<P>If the <I>prepend</I> keyword is set, its value should be a directory name
(without the trailing "/").  This will be prepended to every input and
output pathname used by OINK, including the scratch directory noted
above.  This global setting can be overridden for a single input or
output of the next-executed <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> by setting
the same <I>prepend</I> keyword in the <A HREF = "input.html">input</A> or
<A HREF = "output.html">output</A> command.
</P>
<P>Input file or directory names can contain the wildcard character "%".
Only the first occurrence of the wildcard character is replaced.
</P>
<P>If the <I>substitute</I> keyword is set to 0, then a "%" is replaced by the
processor ID, 0 to Nprocs-1.  If it is set to N > 0, then "%" is
replaced by (proc-ID % N) + 1.  I.e. for 8 processors and N = 4, then
the 8 processors replace the "%" with (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4).  This can be
useful for multi-core nodes where each core has its own local disk.
E.g. you wish each core to read data from one disk.
</P>
<P>As with the <I>prepend</I> keyword, this substitution rule will be applied
to every input and output pathname used by OINK, including the scratch
directory noted above.  This global setting can be overridden for a
single input or output of the next-executed <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A> by setting the same <I>substitute</I> keyword in the
<A HREF = "input.html">input</A> or <A HREF = "output.html">output</A> command.

<P><B>Defaults:</B>
</P>
<P>The setting defaults are the same as for the MR-MPI library itself,
namely verbosity = 0, timer = 0, memsize = 64, outofcore = 0, minpage
= 0, maxpage = 0, freepage = 1, zeropage = 0, scratch = ".".  There
are additional default values: prepend = NULL, and substitute = 0.
