<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command assigns one or more strings to a variable name for
evaluation later in the input script or during a simulation.
</P>
<P>Variables can be used in several ways in OINK.  A variable can be
referenced elsewhere in an input script to become part of a new input
command.  For variable styles that store multiple strings, the
<A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command can be used to increment which string is
assigned to the variable.  Variables of style <I>equal</I> store a formula
which when evaluated produces a single numeric value which can be
output via the <A HREF = "print.html">print</A> command.  Variables that store a
collection of strings can be used as input to a named command, e.g. to
process a collection of filenames.  See the <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A> doc page for details.
</P>
<P>In the discussion that follows, the "name" of the variable is the
arbitrary string that is the 1st argument in the variable command.
This name can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.
The "string" is one or more of the subsequent arguments.  The "string"
can be simple text as in the 1st example above, it can contain other
variables as in the 2nd example, or it can be a formula as in the 3rd
example.  The "value" is the numeric quantity resulting from
evaluation of the string.  Note that the same string can generate
different values when it is evaluated at different times during a
simulation.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When the input script line that defines a variable of
style <I>equal</I> is encountered, the formula is NOT immediately evaluated
and the result stored.  See the discussion below about "Immediate
Evaluation of Variables" if you want to do this.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: When a variable command is encountered in the input
script and the variable name has already been specified, the command
is ignored.  This means variables can NOT be re-defined in an input
script (with 2 exceptions, read further).  This is to allow an input
script to be processed multiple times without resetting the variables;
see the <A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> or <A HREF = "include.html">include</A> commands.  It also
means that using the <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">command-line switch</A> -var
will override a corresponding index variable setting in the input
script.
</P>
<P>There are two exceptions to this rule.  First, variables of style
<I>string</I> and <I>equal</I> ARE redefined each time the command is
encountered.  This allows these style of variables to be redefined
multiple times in an input script.  In a loop, this means the formula
associated with an <I>equal</I>-style variable can change if it contains a
substitution for another variable, e.g. $x.
</P>
<P>Second, as described below, if a variable is iterated on to the end of
its list of strings via the <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command, it is removed
from the list of active variables, and is thus available to be
re-defined in a subsequent variable command.  The <I>delete</I> style does
the same thing.
</P>
<HR>

<P><A HREF = "Section_script.html#2_2">This section</A> of the manual explains how
occurrences of a variable name in an input script line are replaced by
the variable's string.  The variable name can be referenced as $x if
the name "x" is a single character, or as ${LoopVar} if the name
"LoopVar" is one or more characters.
</P>
<P>As described below, for variable styles <I>index</I>, <I>loop</I>, <I>universe</I>,
and <I>uloop</I>, which string is assigned to a variable can be incremented
via the <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command.  When there are no more strings to
assign, the variable is exhausted and a flag is set that causes the
next <A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A> command encountered in the input script to be
skipped.  This enables the construction of simple loops in the input
script that are iterated over and then exited from.
</P>
<P>As explained above, an exhausted variable can be re-used in an input
script.  The <I>delete</I> style also removes the variable, the same as if
it were exhausted, allowing it to be redefined later in the input
script or when the input script is looped over.  This can be useful
when breaking out of a loop via the <A HREF = "if.html">if</A> and <A HREF = "jump.html">jump</A>
commands before the variable would become exhausted.  For example,
</P>
<PRE>label	    loop
variable    a loop 5
print	    "A = $a"
if	    $a > 2 then "jump in.script break"
next	    a
jump	    in.script loop
label	    break
variable    a delete 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>index</I> style, one or more strings are specified.  Initially,
the 1st string is assigned to the variable.  Each time a
<A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command is used with the variable name, the next
string is assigned.  All processors assign the same string to the
variable.
</P>
<P><I>Index</I> style variables with a single string value can also be set by
using the command-line switch -var; see <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this
section</A> for details.
</P>
<P>The <I>loop</I> style is identical to the <I>index</I> style except that the
strings are the integers from 1 to N inclusive, if only one argument N
is specified.  This allows generation of a long list of runs
(e.g. 1000) without having to list N strings in the input script.
Initially, the string "1" is assigned to the variable.  Each time a
<A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command is used with the variable name, the next
string ("2", "3", etc) is assigned.  All processors assign the same
string to the variable.  The <I>loop</I> style can also be specified with
two arguments N1 and N2.  In this case the loop runs from N1 to N2
inclusive, and the string N1 is initially assigned to the variable.
</P>
<P>For the <I>world</I> style, one or more strings are specified.  There must
be one string for each processor partition or "world".  See <A HREF = "Section_build.html#1_4">this
section</A> of the manual for information on
running OINK with multiple partitions via the "-partition"
command-line switch.  This variable command assigns one string to each
world.  All processors in the world are assigned the same string.  The
next command cannot be used with <I>equal</I> style variables, since there
is only one value per world.  This style of variable is useful when
you wish to perform different calculations on different partitions.
</P>
<P>For the <I>universe</I> style, one or more strings are specified.  There
must be at least as many strings as there are processor partitions or
"worlds".  See <A HREF = "Section_start.html#2_6">this page</A> for information on
running OINK with multiple partitions via the "-partition"
command-line switch.  This variable command initially assigns one
string to each world.  When a <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> command is encountered
using this variable, the first processor partition to encounter it, is
assigned the next available string.  This continues until all the
variable strings are consumed.  Thus, this command can be used to run
50 simulations on 8 processor partitions.  The simulations will be run
one after the other on whatever partition becomes available, until
they are all finished.  <I>Universe</I> style variables are incremented
using the files "tmp.oink.variable" and "tmp.oink.variable.lock"
which you will see in your directory during such a OINK run.
</P>
<P>The <I>uloop</I> style is identical to the <I>universe</I> style except that the
strings are the integers from 1 to N.  This allows generation of long
list of runs (e.g. 1000) without having to list N strings in the input
script.
</P>
<P>All <I>universe</I>- and <I>uloop</I>-style variables defined in an input script
must have the same number of values.
</P>
<HR>

<P>For the <I>equal</I> style, a single string is specified which represents a
formula that will be evaluated afresh each time the variable is used.
If you want spaces in the string, enclose it in double quotes so the
parser will treat it as a single argument.  The formula computes a
scalar quantity, which becomes the value of the variable whenever it
is evaluated.
</P>
<P>Note that <I>equal</I> variables can produce different values at different
stages of the input script or at different times during a run.  For
example, if the <I>equal</I> variable is printed during a loop, different
values could be printed each time it was invoked.  If you want a
variable to be evaluated immediately, so that the result is stored by
the variable instead of the string, see the section below on
"Immediate Evaluation of Variables".
</P>
<P>The next command cannot be used with <I>equal</I> style variables, since
there is only one string.
</P>
<P>The formula for an <I>equal</I> variable can contain a variety of
quantities.  The syntax for each kind of quantity is simple, but
multiple quantities can be nested and combined in various ways to
build up formulas of arbitrary complexity.
</P>
<P>Specifically, an formula can contain numbers, keywords, math
operators, math functions, and references to other variables.

<HR>

<P>The keywords allowed in a formula are <I>nprocs</I> and <I>time</I>.  Nprocs is
the number of processors being used.  Time is the elapsed time of the
most recently executed <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> or <A HREF = "mrmpi.html">MR-MPI library
command</A>.
</P>
<HR>

<H4>Math Operators 
</H4>
<P>Math operators are written in the usual way, where the "x" and "y" in
the examples can themselves be arbitrarily complex formulas, as in the
examples above. 
</P>
<P>Operators are evaluated left to right and have the usual C-style
precedence: unary minus and unary logical NOT operator "!" have the
highest precedence, exponentiation "^" is next; multiplication and
division are next; addition and subtraction are next; the 4 relational
operators "<", "<=", ">", and ">=" are next; the two remaining
relational operators "==" and "!=" are next; then the logical AND
operator "&&"; and finally the logical OR operator "||" has the lowest
precedence.  Parenthesis can be used to group one or more portions of
a formula and/or enforce a different order of evaluation than what
would occur with the default precedence.
</P>
<P>The 6 relational operators return either a 1.0 or 0.0 depending on
whether the relationship between x and y is TRUE or FALSE.  For
example the expression x<10.0 in an atom-style variable formula will
return 1.0 for all atoms whose x-coordinate is less than 10.0, and 0.0
for the others.  The logical AND operator will return 1.0 if both its
arguments are non-zero, else it returns 0.0.  The logical OR operator
will return 1.0 if either of its arguments is non-zero, else it
returns 0.0.  The logical NOT operator returns 1.0 if its argument is
0.0, else it returns 0.0.
</P>
<HR>

<H4>Math Functions 
</H4>
<P>Math functions are specified as keywords followed by one or more
parenthesized arguments "x", "y", "z", each of which can themselves be
arbitrarily complex formulas.
</P>
<P>Most of the math functions perform obvious operations.  The ln() is
the natural log; log() is the base 10 log. 
</P>
<P>The random(x,y,z) function takes 3 arguments: x = lo, y = hi, and z =
seed.  It generates a uniform random number between lo and hi.  The
normal(x,y,z) function also takes 3 arguments: x = mu, y = sigma, and
z = seed.  It generates a Gaussian variate centered on mu with
variance sigma^2.  In both cases the seed is used the first time the
internal random number generator is invoked, to initialize it.  For
equal-style variables, every processor uses the same seed so that they
each generate the same sequence of random numbers.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: Internally, there is just one random number generator
for all equal-style variables.  If you define multiple variables (of
each style) which use the random() or normal() math functions, then
the internal random number generators will only be initialized once,
which means only one of the specified seeds will determine the
sequence of generated random numbers.
</P>
<P>The ceil(), floor(), and round() functions are those in the C math
library.  Ceil() is the smallest integer not less than its argument.
Floor() if the largest integer not greater than its argument.  Round()
is the nearest integer to its argument.
</P>
<HR>

<H4>Variable References 
</H4>
<P>Variable references access quantities calulated by other variables,
which will cause those variables to be evaluated.  The name in the
reference should be replaced by the name of a variable defined
elsewhere in the input script.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If you define variables in circular manner like this:
</P>
<PRE>variable a equal v_b
variable b equal v_a
print $a 
</PRE>
<P>then OINK may run for a while when the print statement is invoked!
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Immediate Evaluation of Variables:</B>
</P>
<P>There is a difference between referencing a variable with a leading $
sign (e.g. $x or ${abc}) versus with a leading "v_" (e.g. v_x or
v_abc).  The former can be used in any command, including a variable
command, to force the immediate evaluation of the referenced variable
and the substitution of its value into the command.  The latter is a
required kind of argument to some commands (e.g. the <A HREF = "fix_ave_spatial.html">fix
ave/spatial</A> or <A HREF = "dump.html">dump custom</A> or
<A HREF = "thermo_style.html">thermo_style</A> commands) if you wish it to evaluate
a variable periodically during a run.  It can also be used in a
variable formula if you wish to reference a second variable.  The
second variable will be evaluated whenever the first variable is
evaluated.
</P>
<P>As an example, suppose you use this command in your input script to
define the variable "v" as
</P>
<PRE>variable v equal vol 
</PRE>
<P>before a run where the simulation box size changes.  You might think
this will assign the initial volume to the variable "v".  That is not
the case.  Rather it assigns a formula which evaluates the volume
(using the thermo_style keyword "vol") to the variable "v".  If you
use the variable "v" in some other command like <A HREF = "fix_ave_time.html">fix
ave/time</A> then the current volume of the box will be
evaluated continuously during the run.
</P>
<P>If you want to store the initial volume of the system, you can do it
this way:
</P>
<PRE>variable v equal vol
variable v0 equal $v 
</PRE>
<P>The second command will force "v" to be evaluated (yielding the
initial volume) and assign that value to the variable "v0".  Thus the
command
</P>
<PRE>thermo_style custom step v_v v_v0 
</PRE>
<P>would print out both the current and initial volume periodically
during the run.
</P>
<P>Note that it is a mistake to enclose a variable formula in double
quotes if it contains variables preceeded by $ signs.  For example,
</P>
<PRE>variable vratio equal "${vfinal}/${v0}" 
</PRE>
<P>This is because the quotes prevent variable substitution (see <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#3_2">this
section</A> on parsing input script commands),
and thus an error will occur when the formula for "vratio" is
evaluated later.
