<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Invoke a MR-MPI library function directly on a previously created
MR-MPI objects.  In OINK, an MR-MPI object is a thin wrapper on a
MapReduce object created via the <A HREF = "../doc/Manual.html">MR-MPI library</A>.  They can be
created by the <A HREF = "mr.html">mr</A> command or can be output by a <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A>.  Such an MR-MPI object has an ID which is the
command name used in the input script to trigger the library calls,
e.g. "edge" in the examples above.
</P>
<P>The keyword is the library function to invoke on the underlying
MapReduce object wrapped by the MR-MPI object.  These have a
one-to-one correspondence with the methods available in the <A HREF = "../doc/Manual.html">MR-MPI
library</A>.  Here is the list of keywords and their arguments.  The
arguments used in the OINK input script correspond to the arguments
used by each library method.  Arguments in parentheses are optional.
More details are discussed below.

<P>The MR2-ID used as an argument to the "copy", "add", and "map/mr"
keywords should be the ID of another previously defined MR-MPI object.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The syntax for the copy keyword in an OINK script is
as follows: MR-ID copy MR2-ID.  This creates a new MR-MPI object
MR2-ID, which is a copy of the existing MR-MPI object MR-ID.  The
MR2-ID object cannot already exist.  This corresponds to the following
C++ calling syntax for the <A HREF = "../doc/copy.html">copy() method of the MR-MPI
library</A>, but note that the OINK syntax is somewhat
reversed:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr2 = mr->copy(); 
</PRE>
<P>The map-function, reduce-function, hash-function, compare-function,
scan-function arguments to various keywords are the names of functions
that will be called back to by the MR-MPI library.  Within OINK, these
must be names of functions defined in map_*.cpp, reduce_*.cpp,
hash_*.cpp, compare_*,cpp, or scan_*.cpp files with the appropriate
function prototype.  When you build OINK, these files are scanned, the
function prototypes extracted, and the style_map.h, style_reduce.h,
style_hash.h, style_compare.h, style_scan.h files are created whcih
enables a function name you list in your input script to be recognized
by OINK.  Note that as new map(), reduce(), etc functions are added to
the OINK src directory, they automatically become avaiable to your
script to use in MR-MPI library commands.  Thus you can use to OINK to
accumulate a collection of useful map(), reduce(), etc functions.
These functions can also be used with <A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A> as
discussed <A HREF = "Section_command.html">here</A>.
</P>
<P>Note that map() functions come in 4 different flavors, with different
prototypes, as <A HREF = "../doc/map.html">detailed here</A>.  Which you should use
depends on which map variant you invoke, i.e. map/task, map/char,
map/string, or map/mr.  Likewise, scan() functions come in 2 different
flavors, as <A HREF = "../doc/scan.html">detailed here</A>, one for use with scan/kv
and the other with scan/kmv.
</P>
<P>The "strings" argument to the <I>map/char</I> and <I>map/string</I> keywords can
take one of two forms.  It can be a single filename or directory.  If
the latter, then the <A HREF = "../doc/map.html">map() method in the MR-MPI
library</A> reads the files in the directory.  Or it can
be a variable defined elsewhere in the OINK input script that contains
one or more strings which are passed to the map() method as a
collection of strings.  In this case the "strings" argument should be
specified as v_name, where name is the name of the variable.  All the
different styles of variables (except equal-style) store strings; see
the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for details.  Also note that
there is a <A HREF = "Section_build.txt#1_4">command-line option</A> -var or -v
which can be specified when OINK is executed to store a list of
filenames in an index-style variable.
</P>
<P>The sepchar and sepstr arguments to the <I>map/char</I> and <I>map/string</I>
keywords should be a single character or a string of characters.
</P>
<P>The addflag argument to the various <I>map</I> keywords is optional.  It
should be 1 if you wish to add key/value pairs to those already
contained in a MapReduce object.
</P>
<P>The type argument to the <I>collapse</I> and <I>scrunch</I> keywords should be
one of the following: "int", "uint46", "double", or "str".  The key
that follows will be converted into that data type to use as the key
argument to the MR-MPI library function.
</P>
<P>The <I>print</I> keyword takes either 4 or 6 arguments.  If 6 are used, the
first two are a file name and file flag, the same as is available with
the <A HREF = "../doc/print.html">print() method in the MR-MPI library</A>.
</P>
<P>The flag argument to the various <I>sort</I> keywords is an integer (e.g. 1
or -1) that can be used in place of a compare-function.  This is the
same integer that the <A HREF = "../doc/sort.html">sort methods in the MR-MPI
library</A> takes as a valid argument.
</P>
<P>The <I>set</I> keyword takes a "name" and "value" argument.  These can be
any of the options that are valid to set for a MapReduce object in the
MR-MPI library, as <A HREF = "../doc/settings.html">discussed here</A>.  E.g.  the
command "edge verbosity 1" will set the verbosity level to 1 in the
MapReduce object wrapped by the MR-MPI object named "edge".
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: There is currently no way in OINK to pass a data
pointer to the various MR-MPI library functions that accept it,
e.g. to map() or reduce().  When using the library from a programming
language, such as C++ or C, this is powerful option for passing extra
information to the user callback map() or reduce() function.  We are
still thinking about the best way to do this, at least in some limited
fashion, from an OINK input script.
</P>
<HR>

<P>When any MR-MPI library command is executed, its elapsed execution
time is stored internally by OINK.  This value can be accessed by the
keyword "time" in an <A HREF = "variable.html">equal-style variable</A> and printed
out in the following manner:
</P>
<PRE>variable t equal time
edge map/task 100 mymap
print "Time for map/task = $t" 
</PRE>
