<H3>4. Adding Commands to OINK 
</H3>
<P>The purpose of this section is to give details of how to write new
<A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A> that can be added to OINK and which will
be invokable by your input scripts and will interact appropriately
with other OINK commands.
</P>
<P>OINK is designed to make this easy to do with a minimum of special
coding on your part.  Several such named commands are included with
the OINK distribution; more will be added over time.  See <A HREF = "Section_script.html#comm">this
section</A> of the manual for a list of the
current named commands in OINK.  We also invite OINK users to send
email to the developers with new commands they have written and wish
to share, so we can add them to the distribution, attributed to you.
</P>

<HR>

<A NAME = "4_1"></A><H4>4.1 Source files for the new class 
</H4>
<P>In OINK a named command is a child class that derives from the Command
parent class (see src/command.cpp and src/command.h), meaning that it
contains several methods that can be called by the OINK framework.
Adding a new named command to OINK is as simple as writing the code
for it in two new files (e.g. foo.cpp and foo.h), dropping them into
the src directory, and re-building OINK.
</P>
<P>It is easiest to understand the description that follows if you look
at an example named command in OINK.  In what follows we will use the
<A HREF = "deree.html">degree</A> command, contained in src/degree.cpp and
src/degree.h for illustration purposes.
</P>
<P>The *.h file for a new named command should have lines like these
at the top (from the src/degree.h file):
</P>
<PRE>#ifdef COMMAND_CLASS
CommandStyle(degree,Degree)
#else 
</PRE>
<P>CommandStyle(arg1,arg2) is a macro that gets converted by the OINK
build procedure into source code.  Arg1 is the "name" of the named
command, which is how you reference it in your input script, e.g. as
</P>
<PRE>degree -i graphdir -o out/outfile NULL 
</PRE>
<P>Arg2 is the class that implements that command.
</P>
<P>The list of all such named commands will appear in the style_command.h
file after OINK is (re)built, via a make command.
</P>
<P>The remainder of the *.h file (between the #else and final pair of
#endif) is the definition of your new class.  Note that you will need
to include the mapreduce.h file (from the MR-MPI library src dir) and
the MAPREDUCE_NS namespace if your class definition includes any
map(), reduce(), etc callback functions since they have the "KeyValue"
class name in their prototype.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<A NAME = "4_2"></A><H4>4.2 Methods in the new class 
</H4>
<P>When a line in the input script starts with a <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A>, the associated class is instantiated, its
params() and run() methods are called, and the instance of the class
is destroyed.
</P>
<P>The constructor of your new class should set two variables, ninputs
and noutputs, which are the number of input and output descriptors it
requires you to list in the input script.  For the
<A HREF = "degree.html">degree</A> command, ninputs = noutpus = 1, as illustrated in
the example above.
</P>
<P>Your new class is required to define only two methods: params() and
run().
</P>
<P>Params() is passed the list of arguments following the command name,
excluding the "-i" and "-o" arguments, which are processed separately
by the parent Command class.  Your params() method should parse and
check the arguments and generate an error message if the number of
arguments is incorrect or any of their values is invalid.  Note that
the <A HREF = "degree.html">degree</A> command takes 0 arguments.
</P>
<P>Run() is called to invoke the meat of your command and it can perform
any series of MapReduce or other operations you wish, using as many
<A HREF = "../doc/Manual.html">MapReduce objects</A> (from the MR-MPI library) and <A HREF = "mr.html">MR-MPI
objects</A> (managed by OINK) as you wish.  The calls that run()
can make to the OINK object manager (obj) are discussed in the next
section.
</P>
<P>The desstructor of your new class should free any memory it has
allocated, including any local MapReduce objects that it allocated.
Note that this is different from <A HREF = "mr.html">MR-MPI objects</A> and the
underlying MapReduce objects they wrap, and which are often associated
with the input and output descriptors of your command in the input
script; those objects are created/destroyed by OINK itself, as
discussed in the next section.
</P>
<HR>

<HR>

<A NAME = "4_3"></A><H4>4.3 Calls to the OINK object manager 
</H4>
<P>These are the calls that the run() method of your new class can make
to the OINK object manager.  Each is discussed below.  Note that you
make the calls via the "obj" pointer which is visible to your class,
e.g. obj->cleanup().  This means you should add the line
</P>
<PRE>#include "object.h" 
</PRE>
<P>at the top of your *.cpp file.

		    void *ptr, int disallow); 
</PRE>
<PRE>void Object::cleanup(); 
</PRE>
<P>Here is a brief summary of the calls your run() method will
typically make:
</P>
<UL><LI>1 call to input() for each of its Ninput input descriptors
<LI>calls to create_mr() or copy_mr() for additional MapReduce objects it uses
<LI>1 call to output() for each of its Noutput output descriptors
<LI>final call to cleanup() at the end 
</UL>
<P>The details are discussed below.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Your run() method should call one of the 4 variants of the input()
methods one time for each of its inputs.  Which variant it calls
depends on what forms of input you wish to support, which is related
to the "-i" arguments specified with your <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>
in the input script and additional options set by the
<A HREF = "input.html">input</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each call takes an "index" argument which is the index of the input
descriptor being referenced, from 1 to Ninputs.  Each call returns a
pointer to a MapReduce object which will contain the desired input
data as key/value (KV) pairs.  As the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc
page explains, each input descriptor for your command can be specified
in the input script as one or more files or directories or as an
existing MR-MPI object.  For reading files, there are 2 kinds of map()
methods that can be used to convert the file contents into KV pairs,
one where a filename is passed to your callback function, and the
other where a chunk of bytes is passed to your callback function.  See
the <A HREF = "..doc/map.html">map() method</A> doc page for details.
</P>
<P>If you invoke this method:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *Object::input(int index); 
</PRE>
<P>then the input descriptor must be specified in your input script as an
existing MR-MPI object.  No reading of files is allowed.
</P>
<P>If you invoke this method:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *Object::input(int index,
			 void (*map1)(int, char *, KeyValue *, void *),
			 void *ptr); 
</PRE>
<P>then the input can be specified as either an MR-MPI object or as files
which will be processed via the map1() callback function which
receives a filename as an argument, so that it can open the file, read
it, and generate KV pairs.
</P>
<P>If you invoke this method:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *Object::input(int index,
			 void (*map2)(int, char *, int, KeyValue *, void *),
			 void *ptr); 
</PRE>
<P>then the input can be specied as either an MR-MPI object or as files
which will be processed via the map2() callback function which
receives a chunk of bytes read from a file as an arbument, so that it
can convert the byte string into KV pairs.  To use this map2() method,
you would also need to specify an <A HREF = "input.html">input</A> command in your
input script that setup various options needed to call the <A HREF = "../doc/map.html">MR-MPI
library map() method</A> that uses map2() as a callback
function.
</P>
<P>If you invoke the 4th variant:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *Object::input(int index,
			 void (*map1)(int, char *, KeyValue *, void *),
			 void (*map2)(int, char *, int, KeyValue *, void *),
			 void *ptr); 
</PRE>
<P>then both kinds of map() callback functions can be specified, map1()
and map2(), and OINK will select which to use depending on what
options have been setup via the <A HREF = "input.html">input</A> command for this
input descriptor.
</P>
<P>Note that you have to provide the map1() and/or map2() callback
functions to the input() calls, with the correct prototype.  As
discussed below and on <A HREF = "Section_functions.html">this doc page</A>, they
can be static methods in your class, or they can be map() methods in
separate files in the OINK src directory, which are named map_*.cpp.
</P>
<P>Also note that if you want to provide maximum flexibility for using
your <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>, then you should provide one of both
flavors of callback map() functions for allowing input from files
along with input from an existing MR-MPI object.  If you do not
provide either callback or just one of the two, then input scripts
will be limited in what forms of input descriptor they can define.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Your run() method should call one of the 6 variants of the output()
methods one time for each of its outputs.  Which variant it calls
depends on what forms of output you wish to support, which is related
to the "-o" arguments specified with your <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>
in the input script and additional options set by the
<A HREF = "output.html">output</A> command.
</P>
<P>Each call takes an "index" argument which is the index of the output
descriptor being referenced, from 1 to Noutputs.  Each call also takes
a MapReduce object pointer "mr", which contains the data you wish to
output.  As the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page explains, each
output descriptor for your command is specified in the input script
with 2 parts, either of which can be NULL.  The first part is a
filename for writing output to files.  The second part is the ID of an
MR-MPI object which will contain the output.  For writing files, there
are 4 kinds of callback methods that can be used to write the contents
of "mr" to a file.  Each of these 4 methods is called with a "FILE *"
as its final "void *" argument.  This is the file pointer to a file
created and opened (and later closed) by OINK which the callback
method can write its data to.  If you pass your own non-NULL pointer
to the callback method via the "void *ptr" argument to the output()
calls, then it will be appended to the FILE *, so that it can be
dereferenced as a 2nd pointer passed to the callback function.
</P>
<P>If you invoke this method:
</P>
<PRE>void Object::output(int index, MapReduce *mr); 
</PRE>
<P>then the output descriptor must be specified in your input script as
only defining a MR-MPI object for output.  No writing to files is
allowed.  This call will assign the ID specified in your input script
to the MR-MPI object that wraps "mr".  Also note, that this will
remove the ID from any other MR-MPI object that has the same ID.  They
then become unnamed or temporary MR-MPI objects which will be deleted
at the end of your run() method.  See further discussion of temporaray
versus permanent MR-MPI objects in the next section.
</P>
<P>If you invoke one of these 2 methods:
</P>
<PRE>void Object::output(int index, MapReduce *mr,
		    void (*scankv)(char *, int, char *, int, void *), 
		    void *ptr, int disallow);
void Object::output(int index, MapReduce *mr,
		    void (*scankmv)(char *, int, char *, int, int *, void *), 
		    void *ptr, int disallow); 
</PRE>
<P>then the output can be specified as either an MR-MPI object or as
files which will be written to via the scankv() or scankmv() callback
functions respectively.  In the first case, the scankv() function will
receive key/value (KV) pairs, one at time from the "mr" MapReduce
object.  In the second case, the scankmv() function will receive
key/multivalue (KMV) pairs, one at time from the "mr" MapReduce
object.  The MapReduce object will be unaltered by this operation.
See the <A HREF = "..doc/scan.html">scan() method</A> doc page in the MR-MPI library
for details.  The "disallow" flag is explained below.
</P>
<P>If you invoke one of these 2 methods:
</P>
<PRE>void Object::output(int index, MapReduce *mr,
		    void (*map)(uint64_t, char *, int, char *, int, 
				KeyValue *, void *), 
		    void *ptr, int disallow);
void Object::output(int index, MapReduce *mr,
		    void (*reduce)(char *, int, char *, int, int *, 
				   KeyValue *, void *), 
		    void *ptr, int disallow); 
</PRE>
<P>then the output can be specified as either an MR-MPI object or as
files which will be written to via the map() or reduce() callback
functions respectively.  In the first case, the map() function will
receive key/value (KV) pairs, one at time from the "mr" MapReduce
object.  In the second case, the reduce() function will receive
key/multivalue (KMV) pairs, one at time from the "mr" MapReduce
object.  For the first case, the MapReduce object will typically be
unaltered by this operation, since the <A HREF = "..doc/map.html">MR-MPI library map()
method</A> is called with addflag=1, so that the existing
KV pairs are preserved.  But your map() callback function should not
emit any new KV pairs.  For the second case, the MapReduce object will
be altered by this operation, since the <A HREF = "..doc/reduce.html">MR-MPI library reduce()
method</A> deletes the KMV pairs and replaces them with
new KV pairs which your reduce() callback function may or may not
emit.  The "disallow" flag is explained below.
</P>
<P>If you invoke the 6th variant:
</P>
<PRE>void Object::output(int index, MapReduce *mr,
		    void (*scankv)(char *, int, char *, int, void *), 
		    void (*scankmv)(char *, int, char *, int, int *, void *),
		    void (*map)(uint64_t, char *, int, char *, int, 
				KeyValue *, void *), 
		    void (*reduce)(char *, int, char *, int, int *,
				   KeyValue *, void *),
		    void *ptr, int disallow); 
</PRE>
<P>then any of the 4 kinds of callback functions can be specified, namely
scankv(), scankmv(), map(), or reduce().  Those that you do not wish
to provide or that are not compatible with the current state of the
MapReduce object "mr" (which will contain either kV or KMV pairs, but
not both), can be specified as NULL.
</P>
<P>Note that you have to provide each of these 4 callback functions to
the output() calls, with the correct prototype.  As discussed below
and on <A HREF = "Section_functions.html">this doc page</A>, they can be static
methods in your class, or they can be methods in separate files in the
OINK src directory, which are named scan_*.cpp, map_*.cpp, and
reduce_*.cpp respectively.
</P>
<P>Also note that if you want to provide maximum flexibility for using
your <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>, then you should provide at least
one flavor of a callback function for allowing output to files along
with output to an MR-MPI object.  If you do not do this, then input
scripts will be limited in what forms of output descriptor they can
define.
</P>
<P>All but the first of the output() variants can be called with an
optional disallow flag which is set to 0 by default.  If these methods
are called with disallow=1, then no output to an MR-MPI object is
allowed.  This is useful if you expect the run() method of your <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A> to subsequently change the data stored in the
MapReduce object, and thus make the data written to an output file
differ from what is stored in the MapReduce object.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Your run() method may need to use additional MapReduce objects
as workspace, in addition to its inputs.  Some of these may end
up holding the data you wish to output.
</P>
<P>One key point to understand is that the OINK object manager keeps
track of two kinds of MR-MPI objects, each of which is a thin wrapper
on MapReduce objects which hold your key/value (KV) or key/multivalue
(KMV) data.  Each MR-MPI object can be "permanent" meaning it has an
ID which can be referenced by input script commands.  Or it can be
"temporary", meaning it has no ID and was created to hold data input
from a file or by the function calls discussed below.  Permanent
MR-MPI objects persist until they are explicitly deleted by your input
script.  Temporary MR-MPI objects are deleted at the end of your run()
method; they can be thought of as workspace created and used by your
run() method.
</P>
<P>These two calls create a new temporary MR-MPI object and return a
pointer to the MapReduce object contained within it:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *Object::create_mr();
MapReduce *Object::create_mr(int verbosity, int timer,
			     int memsize, int outofcore); 
</PRE>
<P>The first variant will use the default settings for the MapReduce
object; see the <A HREF = "set.html">set</A> command and the <A HREF = "../doc/settings.html">settings doc
page</A> of the MR-MPI library for details.  The
second variant allows you to override a few of the settings with
specified values.
</P>
<P>This call makes a copy of the "mr" MapReduce object, wraps it in a new
temporary MR-MPI object, and returns a pointer to the new MapReduce
object:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *Object::copy_mr(MapReduce *mr); 
</PRE>
<P>There are two reasons to create new and copied MapReduce objects via
these calls, rather than direcly invoking MR-MPI library calls within
your run() method.  I.e. two reasons to do one of these:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr = obj->create_mr();
MapReduce *mr2 = obj->copy(mr); 
</PRE>
<P>instead of one of these:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr = new MapReduce();
MapReduce *mr2 = mr->copy(); 
</PRE>
<P>The first reason is that OINK will manage the memory associated with
the new MR-MPI objects and free them for you at the end of your run()
method; see the cleanup() method discussion below.  The second is that
you can assign an ID to these temporary MR-MPI objects via the
output() calls discussed above, which you cannot do if you create the
MapReduce object directly yourself.  I.e. you cannot pass to an
output() method a pointer to a MapReduce object that you allocated
yourself if that operation will assign an ID (specified in your input
script) to the MR-MPI object.
</P>
<P>You are of course free to create additional MapReduce objects yourself
via direct calls to the MR-MPI library.  In this case you should
insure you free the objects yourself before the run() method ends, so
as not to leak memory.
</P>
<P>One additional point is that it is fine to do this within your run()
method, where mr is a pointer returned by obj->create_mr():
</P>
<PRE>mr = obj->copy(mr); 
</PRE>
<P>whereas you should not do this:
</P>
<PRE>mr = mr->copy(); 
</PRE>
<P>The former simply overwrites the local mr pointer, but OINK will
manage and free the memory if necessary for the underlying MapReduce
objects associated with both the original and new mr pointers. The
latter will leak memory since the underlying MapReduce object
associated with the original mr pointer is lost.
</P>
<P>This call is useful for checking whether a MR-MPI object has
been assigned a name or not, when it was used for input or output:
</P>
<PRE>int Object::permanent(MapReduce *mr); 
</PRE>
<P>It is called using a MapReduce object pointer and returns a 1 if the
associated MR-MPI object that wraps it has a name, and a 0 if it does
not.  There are two uses for this call.
</P>
<P>First, it can be used after an input() call to determine whether the
input was done from a file or an existing MR-MPI object.  In the
former case permanent() will return 0, since the new MR-MPI object
holding the data is unnamed.  In the latter case it will return 1,
since the MR-MPI object holding the data was named in your input
script as one of the "-i" arguments to the <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A>.  If the run() method will subsequently alter
the MapReduce object and it is permanent, you can make a copy of it,
so as to not alter the original.
</P>
<P>Second, it can be used after an output() call to determine whether the
MapReduce object was assigned a name.  This will be the case if a
MR-MPI ID was specified in your input script as one of the "-o"
arguments to the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.  If this is the case,
you typically do not want to alter the data in the MapReduce object
after outputting it.  If you wish to further process the data, you can
make a copy.
</P>
<P>Finally, this method should be called at the end of your run() method
to free all the temporary MR-MPI objects stored by OINK, and perform
other internal cleanup:
</P>
<PRE>void Object::cleanup(); 
</PRE>
<HR>

<A NAME = "4_4"></A><H4>4.4 Calling back to map() and reduce() functions 
</H4>
<P>You run() method will typically invoke various methods from the MR-MPI
library which involve callback functions, e.g. for performing map() or
reduce() operations.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "../doc/Technical.html#callback">MR-MPI library manual</A> discusses
the general rules for passing a pointer to a callback function to a
MR-MPI library method.  Since you will be doing this from within the
class that encodes your <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> you have two
choices.
</P>
<P>First, you can pass a pointer to a static function declared within
your class.  This function cannot directly access any class variables,
but you can pass it the "this" pointer for the class (as the void *
argument to the map() or reduce() function) which the callback
function can use to access class variables indirectly, through that
pointer.  If you do this, then the map() and reduce() methods defined
in your class can only be used by that <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.
</P>
<P>An alternative is to put your callback functions in their own files,
named map_*.cpp for map() functions, reduce_*.cpp for reduce()
functions, compare_*.cpp for compare() functions, hash_*.cpp for
hash() functions, and scan_*.cpp functions.  By doing this the
callback functions can be used by any <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> or
as arguments to the "MR-MPI library commands" used in an input script
to invoke the MR-MPI library methods directly.  See the oink/rmat.cpp
file, which implements the <A HREF = "rmat.html">rmat</A> command, for an example of
a <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> which accesses several of its callback
functions in this manner.
</P>
<P>Each map_*.cpp file (and reduce_*.cpp, compare_*.cpp, etc) can contain
one or more map() (reduce(), compare(), etc) callback functions.
These are not class methods, but stand-alone functions.  See examples
in the oink directory.  The header files that contain the prototypes
for these functions are named style_map.h, style_reduce.h, etc and are
auto-generated when OINK is built.  Your <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>
class, e.g. rmat.cpp, simply needs to include these style header files
in order to use any of the callback functions in OINK.  Likewise, any
callback function included in one of these files can be accessed by
name in your input script when using one of the <A HREF = "mrmpi.html">MR-MPI library
commands</A>.  Documentation for the collection of map(),
reduce(), etc functions is also auto-extracted and included in <A HREF = "Section_functions.html">this
section</A> of the OINK documentation.
Instructions on how to pass generic pointers to the callback functions
is also discussed in <A HREF = "Section_functions.html">this section</A>.
</P>
<P>It is also possible in the run() method of your <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A> to select a callback function based on an input
script parameter to your command.  For example, the input script could
list the name of a particular compare() function you wish to you to
use to sort the data in a MapReduce object.  By calling the
appropriate lookup() method in the MRMPI class (oink/mrmpi.cpp), the
parameter string can be converted into a matching function pointer.
For example, consider these lines of code:
</P>
<PRE>MapReduce *mr = obj->create_mr();
...
CompareFnPtr compare = compare_lookup(userparam);
mr->sort_keys(compare); 
</PRE>
<P>In this example "userparam" is a string, listed in the input script as
a command parameter, which contains a function name,
e.g. mySpecialCompare.  Assuming that function is included in OINK in
a compare_*.cpp file, the the compare_lookup() method will be able to
match the string to the function and return a pointer to the function
which can then be used as an argument to the
<A HREF = "../doc/sort.html">sort_keys()</A> MR-MPI library method.
</P>
<P>The definition of CompareFnPtr and all other callback function
pointers is in the "typedefs.h" file, which can be included at the top
of your <A HREF = "command.html">named commmand</A> *.cpp file.
