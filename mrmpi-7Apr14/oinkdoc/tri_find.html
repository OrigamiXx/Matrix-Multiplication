<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which enumerates all the triangles in an
undirected graph.  A triangle is a set of 3 vertices I,J,K for which
the edges IJ, JK, IK all exist.  The triangles are found via the
MapReduce algorithm of <A HREF = "#Cohen">(Cohen)</A> discussed in his paper and in
the paper of <A HREF = "#Plimpton">(Plimpton)</A>.  Note that even small graphs can
have large numbers of triangles if there are very high-degree
vertices.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in which
the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  This means that either (Vi,Vj) or (Vj,Vi) appears, but
not both.  Also (Vi,Vi) does not appear.  The input is unchanged by
this command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the list of triangles.
