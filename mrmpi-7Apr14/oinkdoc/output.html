</P>
<P>This command is used to control the writing of data that a <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A> performs as part of its output.  It does this by
setting options on specific outputs to <A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A>.
The options set by this command are in effect for ONLY the next named
commmand.  After a named command is invoked, it restores all output
options to their default values.  Note that all of the options which
can be set by this command have default values, so you don't need to
set those you don't want to change.
</P>
<P>As described on the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page, a named
command may specify one or more output descriptors.  Each descriptor
is a pair of arguemnts, the first of which is an output filename (if
it is not specified as NULL).  OINK converts the specified argument
into an actual filename which is opened by each processor.  The
purpose of the output command is to give you control over how that
conversion takes place.
</P>
<P>The <I>N</I> value corresponds to a particular output descriptor, as
defined by the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.  It should be an integer
from 1 to Noutput, where Noutput is the number of output descriptors
the command requires.  The output command can be used multiple times
with the same <I>N</I> to specify different parameters, e.g. one at a time.
</P>
<P>The remaining arguments are pairs of <I>keywords</I> and <I>values</I>.  One
or more can be specified.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>prepend</I> and <I>substitute</I> keywords alter the file and directory
path names specified with the filename of an output descriptor in a
named command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>prepend</I> and <I>substitute</I> keywords can also be
set globally so that their values will be applied to all output
descriptors of all <A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A>.  See the
<A HREF = "set.html">set</A> command for details.  If an output command is not used
to override the global value, then the global value is used by the
<A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.
</P>
<P>The <I>prepend</I> keyword specifies a path name to prepend to the output
file specified with the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.  The prepend
string is presumed to be a directory name and should be specified
without the trailing "/" character, since that is added when the
prepending is done.
</P>
<P>Ouptut file or directory names specified with the <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A> can contain either or both of two wildcard
characters: "%" or "*".  Only the first occurrence of each wildcard
character is replaced.
</P>
<P>If the <I>substitute</I> keyword is set to 0, then a "%" is replaced by the
processor ID, 0 to Nprocs-1.  If it is set to N > 0, then "%" is
replaced by (proc-ID % N) + 1.  I.e. for 8 processors and N = 4, then
the 8 processors replace the "%" with (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4).  This can be
useful for multi-core nodes where each core has its own local disk.
E.g. you wish each core to write data to one disk.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The proessor ID is also added as a suffix to the
specified output file by each processor, so that one output file per
processor is generated.  This is in addition to any replacement of a
"%" wildcard character.
</P>
<P>If a "*" appears, then it is replaced with a 1.  Unlike for <A HREF = "input.html">input
files</A>, this is not a particularly useful wildcard for
output files.
