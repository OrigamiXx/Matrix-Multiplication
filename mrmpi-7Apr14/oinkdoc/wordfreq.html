<H3>wordfreq command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>wordfreq Ntop -i in1 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>Ntop = print Ntop of the most frequently occurring words to screen
<LI>in1 = words: Key = word, Value = NULL
<LI>out1 = frequency count of each word: Key = word, Value = count 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>wordfreq 10 -i v_files -o full.list NULL
wordfreq 10 -i v_files -o NULL NULL 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which calculates the frequency of word
occurrence in an input data set, which is typically a set of files.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of words.  The input is unchanged by this command.
</P>
<P>If the input is one or more files then the files are read and each
"word" is defined as separated by whitespace.  Note that you can pass
a list of files as the input argument after the "-i" argument by using
a variable, which in turn can be initialized with a command-line
argument to OINK.  E.g. this line would work with the first example
above:
</P>
<PRE>oink_linux -var files *.cpp < in.script 
</PRE>
<P>See <A HREF = "Section_build.html#1_4">this section</A> of the manual and the
<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> doc page for more details.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the frequency count of all unique words.
</P>
<P>Additional statistics can be generated and printed via the <I>Ntop</I>
setting.  The highest frequency <I>Ntop</I> words will be printed to the
screen with their count, in sorted order.  If <I>Ntop</I> is 0, nothing is
printed.
