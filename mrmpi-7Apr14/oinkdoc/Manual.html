<H4>Version info: 
</H4>
<P>The OINK "version" is the date when it was released, such as 1 Feb
2011.  OINK and MR-MPI library are updated continuously.  Whenever we
fix a bug or add a feature, we release it immediately, and post a
notice on <A HREF = "http://mapreduce.sandia.gov/bug.html">this page of the WWW site</A>.  Each dated copy of OINK
contains all the features and bug-fixes up to and including that
version date. The version date is printed to the screen and log file
every time you run OINK. It is also in the file oink/version.h and in
the MR-MPI directory name created when you unpack a tarball.
</P>
<UL><LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages for OINK on the MR-MPI WWW
site, they always describe the most current version of OINK. 

<LI>If you browse the HTML or PDF doc pages for OINK included in your
tarball, they describe the version you have. 
</UL>
<P>OINK is a simple scripting wrapper around the "MapReduce-MPI<A HREF = "http://mapreduce.sandia.gov">
library</A>, and also provides a easy-to-use development framework
for writing new MapReduce algorithms and codes.  Like the MR-MPI
library, OINK will run on any platform (serial or parallel) that
supports <A HREF = "mpi">MPI</A>.  Note the MR-MPI library has its own <A HREF = "../doc/Manual.html">manual and
doc pages</A>.
</P>
<P>The name OINK is meant to evoke the aroma of the <A HREF = "http://pig.apache.org">Apache Pig</A>
platform which wraps the <A HREF = "http://hadoop.apache.org">Hadoop</A> MapReduce capabilities with
its high-level Pig Latin language.  Since OINK has only a small
fraction of Pig's capability, it is more the sound of a pig, than the
pig itself.
</P>
<P>Source code for OINK and the MR-MPI library were developed at Sandia
National Laboratories, a US Department of Energy facility.  They are
freely available for download from the <A HREF = "http://mapreduce.sandia.gov">MR-MPI web site</A> and are
distributed under the terms of the modified <A HREF = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_license">Berkeley Software
Distribution (BSD) License</A>.  This basically means they can be
used by anyone for any purpose.  See the LICENSE file provided with
the distribution for more details.
</P>
<P>The authors of OINK and the MR-MPI library are <A HREF = "http://www.sandia.gov/~sjplimp">Steve Plimpton</A> at
and <A HREF = "http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~kddevin">Karen Devine</A> who can be contacted via email: sjplimp,kddevin

<H4>Goals of OINK 
</H4>
<UL><LI>(1) To allow MapReduce algorithms which call the MR-MPI library to be
written with a minimum of extraneous code, to work with input/output
in various forms, and to be chained together and driven via a simple,
yet versatile scripting language. 

<LI>(2) To create an archive of map() and reduce() functions for re-use by
different algorithms. 

<LI>(3) To provide a scripted interface to the lo-level MR-MPI library
calls that can speed development/debugging of new algortihms before
coding them up in C++ or another language. 
</UL>
<P>We think the first two goals are largely met.  See the section on
<A HREF = "Section_commands.html">Adding Commands to OINK</A> and the <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A>, <A HREF = "input.html">input</A>, and <A HREF = "output.html">output</A>
doc pages for details of the first goal.  See the section on <A HREF = "Section_functions.txt">Adding
Functions to OINK</A> for details of the second
goal.
</P>
<P>The third goal, however, is only partially met.  See the <A HREF = "mrmpi.html">MR-MPI
library commands</A> doc page for its current status.  The
sticking point here is that in a real programming language you can
pass a pointer to an arbitrary data structure to your map() or
reduce() functions, but it is hard to do that from a scripting
language using text input without re-inventing something like
<A HREF = "http://www.python.org">Python</A>.

<CENTER><H4>Contents of OINK Manual

<P>OINK aims to be a simple scripting interface and development
environment and the lightweight documentation reflects that.
</P>
<P>Once you are familiar with OINK, you may want to bookmark <A HREF = "Section_script.html#comm">this
page</A> at Section_script.html#comm since it
gives quick access to documentation for all OINK commands.
