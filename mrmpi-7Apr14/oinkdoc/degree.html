<H3>degree command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>degree dupflag -i in1 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>dupflag = 1/2 for counting edge once/twice
<LI>in1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
<LI>out1 = degree of each vertex: Key = Vi, Value = degree 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>degree 1 -i mrv -o degree.list NULL
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which calculates the degree of each vertex in
a graph.
</P>
<P>If the dupflag is 2, then each edge increments the degree of both of
its vertices.  If the dupflag is 1, then each edge only increments the
degree of the first of its vertices.  The former is usually more
approrpriate for undirected graphs; the latter for directed graphs, in
which case the out-degree of each vertex is being calculated.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges.  No assumption is made about duplicates or
self edges, i.e. (Vi,Vj) may appear multiple times, both (Vi,Vj) or
(Vj,Vi) may appear, as may (Vi,Vi).  The input is unchanged by this
command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the degree count of each vertex.
