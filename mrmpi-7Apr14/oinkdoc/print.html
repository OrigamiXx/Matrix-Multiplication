<H3>print command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>print str 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>str = text string to print, which may contain variables 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>print "Done with first stage"
print "Elapsed time = $t secs on $p procs"
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Print a text string to the screen and logfile.  One line of output is
generated.  If the string has white space in it (spaces, tabs, etc),
then you must enclose it in quotes so that it is treated as a single
argument.  If variables are included in the string, they will be
evaluated and their current values printed.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for a description of various
kinds of variables, any of which can be used with the print command.
Note that there are keywords for the number of processors
and elapsed time for a command or MR-MPI library call which
can be accessed with variables, e.g.
</P>
<PRE>variable t equal time
variable p equal nprocs
print "Elapsed time = $t secs on $p procs" 
</PRE>
