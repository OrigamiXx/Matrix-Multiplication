<H3>2. OINK Commands 
</H3>
<P>This section describes OINK input scripts and what commands are used
to define an OINK calculation.
</P>
2.1 <A HREF = "#2_1">Input script operation</A><BR>
2.2 <A HREF = "#2_2">Parsing rules</A><BR>
2.3 <A HREF = "#2_3">Input script commands</A> <BR>

<HR>

<A NAME = "3_1"></A><H4>2.1 Input script operation 
</H4>
<P>OINK executes by reading commands from a input script (text file), one
line at a time.  When the input script ends, OINK exits.  Each command
causes OINK to take some action.  It may set an internal variable,
read in a file, or perform a MapReduce operation.  Most commands have
default settings, which means you only need to use the command if you
wish to change the default.
</P>
<P>Note that OINK does not read your entire input script and then perform
a calculation with all the settings.  Rather, the input script is read
one line at a time and each command takes effect when it is read.
Thus this sequence of commands:
</P>
<PRE>set verbosity 1 
mr foo 
</PRE>
<P>does something different than this sequence:
</P>
<PRE>mr foo
set verbosity 1 
</PRE>
<P>In the first case, the MR object created will have its verbosity set
to 1.  In the latter case it will have the default verbosity of 0,
since the set command was not used until after the MR object was
created.
</P>
<P>Many input script errors are detected by OINK and an ERROR or WARNING
message is printed.  <A HREF = "Section_errors.html">This section</A> gives more
information on what errors mean.  The documentation for each command
gives additional information.
</P>
<HR>

<A NAME = "3_2"></A><H4>2.2 Parsing rules 
</H4>
<P>Each non-blank line in the input script is treated as a command.  OINK
commands are case sensitive.  Pre-defined command names are
lower-case, as are specified command arguments.  Upper case letters
may be used in file names or user-chosen ID strings.
</P>
<P>Here is how each line in the input script is parsed by OINK:
</P>
<P>(1) If the last printable character on the line is a "&" character
(with no surrounding quotes), the command is assumed to continue on
the next line.  The next line is concatenated to the previous line by
removing the "&" character and newline.  This allows long commands to
be continued across two or more lines.
</P>
<P>(2) All characters from the first "#" character onward are treated as
comment and discarded.  See an exception in (6).  Note that a
comment after a trailing "&" character will prevent the command from
continuing on the next line.  Also note that for multi-line commands a
single leading "#" will comment out the entire command.
</P>
<P>(3) The line is searched repeatedly for $ characters, which indicate
variables that are replaced with a text string.  See an exception in
(6).  If the $ is followed by curly brackets, then the variable name
is the text inside the curly brackets.  If no curly brackets follow
the $, then the variable name is the single character immediately
following the $.  Thus ${myTemp} and $x refer to variable names
"myTemp" and "x".  See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for
details of how strings are assigned to variables and how they are
substituted for in input script commands.
</P>
<P>(4) The line is broken into "words" separated by whitespace (tabs,
spaces).  Note that words can thus contain letters, digits,
underscores, or punctuation characters.
</P>
<P>(5) The first word is the command name.  All successive words in the
line are arguments.
</P>
<P>(6) If you want text with spaces to be treated as a single argument,
it can be enclosed in either double or single quotes.  E.g.
</P>
<PRE>print "Value = $t"
print 'Value = $t' 
</PRE>
<P>The quotes are removed when the single argument is stored internally.
See the <A HREF = "if.html">if</A> commands for examples.  A "#" or "$" character
that is between quotes will not be treated as a comment indicator in
(2) or substituted for as a variable in (3).
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: If the argument is itself a command that requires a
quoted argument (e.g. using a <A HREF = "print.html">print</A> command as part of an
<A HREF = "if.html">if</A> command), then the double and single quotes can be nested
in the usual manner.  See the doc pages for those commands for
examples.  Only one of level of nesting is allowed, but that should be
sufficient for most use cases.
</P>
