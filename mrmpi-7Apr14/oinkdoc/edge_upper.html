<PRE>edge_upper -i in1 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>in1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
<LI>out1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL 
</UL>

<PRE>edge_upper -i tmp.matrix -o mre 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which eliminates duplicate and self-edges from
a graph.  A duplicate edge is when both (Vi,Vj) or (Vj,Vi) appear in
the edge list.  A self-edge is when (Vi,Vi) appears.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges, which may have duplicates or self edges.
The input is unchanged by this command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the edges of a new graph which has the duplicates and
self edges removed.  In the new graph, Vi < Vj for every edge, so it
also represents the non-zeroes of an upper-triangular matrix.
