<H3>1. Building OINK 
</H3>
<P>This section describes how to build and run OINK, which is a simple
C++ program which wraps the MapReduce-MPI (MR-MPI) library.
</P>

<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "1_1"></A>1.1 Making OINK 
</H4>
<P>All of the OINK source files are in the "oink" directory of the MR-MPI
distribution tarball.  The "src" directory contains the source files
for the MR-MPI library itself.
</P>
<P>These are the 4 steps to building OINK:
</P>
<UL><LI>(1) Insure MPI is installed on your system.
<LI>(2) Build the MR-MPI library.
<LI>(3) Use or create a oink/MAKE/Makefile.machine file appropriate for your machine.
<LI>(4) Type "make machine" 
</UL>
<P>Here are more details on each step:
</P>
<P>(1) MPI installation
</P>
<P>MPI is the message passing interface library, which is likely already
installed on your Linux box or Mac, and on most parallel machines.  If
not, it is freely available.  The two most commonly used generic
versions are <A HREF = "openmpi">OpenMPI</A> and <A HREF = "mpich">MPICH</A>.  Download and
install one of these if you need to.  The default installation
location on Linux is under /usr/local.
</P>
<P>Or if you do not plan to run the MR-MPI library or OINK in parallel,
you can use the provided dummy MPI library in the mpistubs dir.  From
mpistubs, type "make" and you should get a libmpi.a file.  If not, you
may need to edit the mpistubs/Makefile.
</P>
<P>(2) Build the MR-MPI library
</P>
<P>See <A HREF = "../doc/Start.html">this section</A> of the MapReduce-MPI library doc
pages for instructions on how to do this.  When you have done this a
file named src/libmrmpi_machine.a should exist.
</P>
<P>(3) Create a Makefile.machine appropriate for your machine.
</P>
<P>See the oink/MAKE dir for examples of these.  You
may be able to use one of these, or edit one that
is close to create one for your machine.
</P>
<P>The only settings you need to worry about are those in the top
section.  Set the C++ compiler name and settings appropriate for your
box.  The only extra libraries used by OINK are MPI and MR-MPI.  The
settings for the latter are already present in the Makefile.machine
files.  You may need to change the MPI settings depending on how you
did your installation.
</P>
<P>If you use the MPI compiler wrappers (mpiCC) for building an MPI-based
program like OINK, then you likely need no additional -I or -L or LIB
settings.
</P>
<P>If you use your system compilers directly, e.g. g++, then
you will typically need these MPI-related settings:
</P>
<UL><LI>An -I setting for where to find the file mpi.h.
<LI>A -L setting for where the MPI library is, libmpich.a
<LI>A LIB setting for the MPI library, e.g. -lmpich 
</UL>
<P>If you are using the provided dummy MPI library (no parallelism), then
see MAKE/Makefile.serial for how to compile/link with it.
</P>
<P>Note that you should insure you build both OINK and the MR-MPI library
with the same MPI.  If not, confusion will ensue.
</P>
<P>(4) Type "make machine"
</P>
<P>Do this from the oink directory where its source files are.
If you just type "make" you will see what machine options
are available (first line of oink/MAKE/Makefile.machine files).
Some other options are also listed, e.g. for cleaning up.
</P>
<P>If you type "make machine", an executable file oink_machine should be
created, e.g. oink_linux or oink_mac.  If that happens, you're done.
</P>
<P>If some error is generated, then you'll need to edit your
oink/MAKE/Makefile.machine.  Find a local make or machine expert to
help if you have problems.
</P>
<P>If you build OINK on a new kind of machine, for which there isn't a
similar Makefile for in the oink/MAKE directory, send it to the
developers and we'll add it to the OINK distribution.
</P>
<P>You can make OINK for multiple platforms from the same oink directory.
Each target creates its own object sub-directory called Obj_name where
it stores the system-specific *.o files.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "1_4"></A>1.2 Building OINK as a library 
</H4>
<P>OINK can be built as a library, which can then be called from another
application or a scripting language.  This is done by typing:
</P>
<PRE>make makelib
make -f Makefile.lib foo 
</PRE>
<P>where foo is the machine name.  The first "make" command will create a
current Makefile.lib with all the file names in your src dir.  The 2nd
"make" command will use it to build OINK as a library.  This requires
that Makefile.foo have a library target (lib) and system-specific
settings for ARCHIVE and ARFLAGS.  See Makefile.linux for an example.
The build will create the file liboink_foo.a which another application
can link to.
</P>
<P>When used from a C++ program, the library allows one or more OINK
objects to be instantiated.  All of OINK is wrapped in a OINK_NS
namespace; you can safely use any of its classes and methods from
within your application code, as needed.
</P>
<P>When used from a C or Fortran program or a scripting language, the
library has a simple C-style interface, provided in oink/library.cpp
and oink/library.h.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "1_3"></A>1.3 Running OINK 
</H4>
<P>By default, OINK runs by reading commands from stdin; e.g. oink_linux
< in.file.  This means you first create an input script (e.g. in.file)
containing the desired commands.  <A HREF = "Section_commands.html">This section</A>
describes how input scripts are structured and what commands they
contain.
</P>
<P>You can test OINK on any of the sample inputs provided in the examples
directory.  OINK input scripts are named in.*.
</P>
<P>Here is how you might run one of the tests on a Linux box, using
mpirun to launch a parallel job:
</P>
<PRE>cd src
make -f Makefile.linux       # builds src/libmrmpi.a
cd ../oink
make linux                   # builds oink/oink_linux
cd ../examples
mpirun -np 4 ../oink/oink_linux ../doc/*.txt < in.wordcount 
</PRE>
<P>If OINK encounters errors in the input script or while running a
command it will print an ERROR message and stop or a WARNING message
and continue.  See <A HREF = "Section_errors.html">this section</A> for a discussion
of the various kinds of errors OINK can or can't detect, a list of all
ERROR and WARNING messages, and what to do about them.
</P>
<P>OINK can run a MapReduce calculation on any number of processors,
including a single processor.
</P>
<HR>

<H4><A NAME = "2_6"></A>2.6 Command-line options 
</H4>
<P>At run time, OINK recognizes several optional command-line switches
which may be used in any order.  Either the full
word or the one-letter abbreviation can be used:
</P>
<UL><LI>-echo or -e
<LI>-partition or -p
<LI>-in or -i
<LI>-log or -l
<LI>-screen or -s
<LI>-var or -v 
</UL>
<P>For example, oink_ibm might be launched as follows:
</P>
<PRE>mpirun -np 16 oink_ibm -var file tmp.out -log my.log -screen none < in.graph 
</PRE>
<P>Here are the details on the options:
</P>
<PRE>-echo style 
</PRE>
<P>Set the style of command echoing.  The style can be <I>none</I> or <I>screen</I>
or <I>log</I> or <I>both</I>.  Depending on the style, each command read from
the input script will be echoed to the screen and/or logfile.  This
can be useful to figure out which line of your script is causing an
input error.  The default value is <I>log</I>.  The echo style can also be
set by using the <A HREF = "echo.html">echo</A> command in the input script itself.
</P>
<PRE>-partition 8x2 4 5 ... 
</PRE>
<P>Invoke OINK in multi-partition mode.  When OINK is run on P processors
and this switch is not used, OINK runs in one partition, i.e. all P
processors run a single calculation.  If this switch is used, the P
processors are split into separate partitions and each partition runs
its own calculation.  The arguments to the switch specify the number
of processors in each partition.  Arguments of the form MxN mean M
partitions, each with N processors.  Arguments of the form N mean a
single partition with N processors.  The sum of processors in all
partitions must equal P.  Thus the command "-partition 8x2 4 5" has 10
partitions and runs on a total of 25 processors.
</P>
<P>Note that with MPI installed on a machine (e.g. your desktop), you can
run on more (virtual) processors than you have physical processors.
</P>
<P>The input script specifies what simulation is run on which partition;
see the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> and <A HREF = "next.html">next</A> commands.
</P>
<PRE>-in file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file to use as an input script.  This is an optional switch
when running OINK in one-partition mode.  If it is not specified, OINK
reads its input script from stdin - e.g. oink_linux < in.run.  This is
a required switch when running OINK in multi-partition mode, since
multiple processors cannot all read from stdin.
</P>
<PRE>-log file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a log file for OINK to write status information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, OINK writes to the file
log.oink.  If this switch is used, OINK writes to the specified file.
In multi-partition mode, if the switch is not used, a log.oink file is
created with hi-level status information.  Each partition also writes
to a log.oink.N file where N is the partition ID.  If the switch is
specified in multi-partition mode, the hi-level logfile is named
"file" and each partition also logs information to a file.N.  For both
one-partition and multi-partition mode, if the specified file is
"none", then no log files are created.  Using a <A HREF = "log.html">log</A> command
in the input script will override this setting.
</P>
<PRE>-screen file 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a file for OINK to write its screen information to.  In
one-partition mode, if the switch is not used, OINK writes to the
screen.  If this switch is used, OINK writes to the specified file
instead and you will see no screen output.  In multi-partition mode,
if the switch is not used, hi-level status information is written to
the screen.  Each partition also writes to a screen.N file where N is
the partition ID.  If the switch is specified in multi-partition mode,
the hi-level screen dump is named "file" and each partition also
writes screen information to a file.N.  For both one-partition and
multi-partition mode, if the specified file is "none", then no screen
output is performed.
</P>
<PRE>-var name value1 value2 ... 
</PRE>
<P>Specify a variable that will be defined for substitution purposes when
the input script is read.  "Name" is the variable name which can be a
single character (referenced as $x in the input script) or a full
string (referenced as ${abc}).  An <A HREF = "variable.html">index-style
variable</A> will be created and populated with the
subsequent values, e.g. a set of filenames.  Using this command-line
option is equivalent to putting the line "variable name index value1
value2 ..."  at the beginning of the input script.  Defining an index
variable as a command-line argument overrides any setting for the same
index variable in the input script, since index variables cannot be
re-defined.  See the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command for more info on
defining index and other kinds of variables and <A HREF = "Section_commands.html#3_2">this
section</A> for more info on using variables in
input scripts.
