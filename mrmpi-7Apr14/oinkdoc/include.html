<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command opens a new input script file and begins reading OINK
commands from that file.  When the new file is finished, the original
file is returned to.  Include files can be nested as deeply as
desired.  If input script A includes script B, and B includes A, then
OINK could run for a long time.
</P>
<P>If the filename is a variable (see the <A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A>
command), different processor partitions can run different input
scripts.
