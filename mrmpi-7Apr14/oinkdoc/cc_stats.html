<H3>cc_stats command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>cc_stats -i in1 
</PRE>
<P>in1 = component assignment for each vertex: Key = Vi, Value = Ci
</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>cc_stats -i ccdir 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which summarizes and prints out the statistics
on connected components (CCs) that each vertex in a graph belongs to.
For each component size n, one line is printed to the screen with the
number of components of size n.  This is done in sorted order.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of vertices Vi and the component ID Ci which each is
assigned to.  Typically this will have been computed previously by the
<A HREF = "cc_find.html">cc_find</A> command.  The input is unchanged by this
command.
</P>
<P>This command produces no output, other than what is written to the
screen.
