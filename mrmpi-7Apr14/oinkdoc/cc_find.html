<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which finds all the connected components (CCs)
in an undirected graph.  A connected component is a set of vertices
where each is connected to one or more other vertices in the set via
an edge.  The CCs are found via the MapReduce algorithm of
<A HREF = "#Cohen">(Cohen)</A> discussed in his paper with extensions described in
the paper of <A HREF = "#Plimpton">(Plimpton)</A> which attempt to load-balance the
calculation across processors when one or a few very large components
exist in the graph.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in which
the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  This means that either (Vi,Vj) or (Vj,Vi) appears, but
not both.  Also (Vi,Vi) does not appear.  The input is unchanged by
this command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the assignment of each vertex in the graph to a
component ID.  The component ID is the smallest vertex ID of any
vertex in the component.
