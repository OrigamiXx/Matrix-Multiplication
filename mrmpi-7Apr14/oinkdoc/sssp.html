<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>These are named commands which compute the shortest path to each
vertex from a source vertex in an undirected graph.  This is called a
single-source shortest-path (SSSP) calculation.  The source vertex is
selected randomly.  Each edge in the graph has a weight.  The
shortest-path distance to any other vertex is the minimum summed
weight of a list of consecutive edges that connect the two vertices.
</P>
<P>This calculation involves a breadth-first search on the graph.  The
MapReduce algorithms used for performing the SSSP calculation are
described in the paper of <A HREF = "#Plimpton">(Plimpton)</A>.  The sssp command
implements the first of the two algorithms discussed in the paper.
The sssp2 command implements the second of the two algorithms.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in which
the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges with floating point weights, assumed to have
no duplicates or self-edges.  This means that either (Vi,Vj) or
(Vj,Vi) appears, but not both.  Also (Vi,Vi) does not appear.  The
input is unchanged by this command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the list of vertices and the distance to each vertex.
If the specified N > 1, then this will be the SSSP result for only the
last source vertex randomly selected.
