\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

% Context

An optimal algorithm for matrix multiplication is elusive, despite the
substantial amount of work on this problem.  We focus on the square
variant of the matrix multiplication problem, that is, given two
$n$-by-$n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ over a field $\F$, the goal is to
compute the matrix product $C = A \times B$.  The question that arised
is: How many field operations are required to compute $C$.  The
na\"{i}ve algorithm, based on the mathematical definition of matrix
product, runs in time $O(n^3)$, and for a time it was thought to be
the optimal algorithm.  It was surprising when Strassen showed that
matrix multiplication can be done in time $O(n^{2.808})$ \cite{str69},
using a divide-and-conquer approach.  A long sequence of work
concluding with Coppersmith and Winograd's laser method that reduced
the running time to $O(2^{2.376})$
\cite{pan78,b79,sch81,cw82,str86,cw87}. Recent refinements of
Coppersmith and Winograd's work done independentally by Stothers,
Vassilevska-Williams, and Le Gall further reduced the exponent to
2.3728639 \cite{sto10,vas11,leg14}.

There are some lower bounds on the time complexity of matrix
multiplication.  Na\"{i}ely, the dimensions of the output matrix $C$
imply that the problem requires at least $\Omega(n^2)$ time.  Slightly
better lower bounds are also known for specialized models of
computation, like bounded-depth arithmetic circuits \cite{XXX}.  There
are also lower bounds known for a variety of algorithmic approaches
for matrix multiplication.  Ambainis et al showed that the laser
method, the approach of Coppersmith-Winograd and subsequent
refinements, cannot alone achieve an algorithm with $O(n^{2.3078})$
running time \cite{afl14}.

From the na\"{i}ve
$O(n^3)$

Cohn and Umans \cite{cu03} introduced an approach for developing
faster algorithms for matrix multiplication by reducing this question
to a search for subsets of groups that satisfy a certain combinatorial
property.

% Motivation


% Approach

Tried many algorithmic approaches to check whether puzzles are strong USP.

% Results

Experimental results suggest that Proposition 3.8 of \cite{cksu05} can
be improved.

\section{Preliminaries}
\label{sec:prelim}

\newcommand\ordset[1]{\ensuremath{[#1]}}

We use $\ordset{n}$ to denote the set $\set{0,1,2,\ldots, n-1}$.  For
a set $Q$, $\Sym{Q}$ denotes the symmetric group on the elements of
$Q$.  \cite{cksu05} introduced the idea of a \emph{puzzle}.

\begin{definition}[Puzzle]
  For $s, k \in \Natural$, an $(s,k)$-\emph{puzzle} is a
  subset $P \sse U_k = \ordset{3}^k$ with $|P| = s$.
\end{definition}

We say that an $(s,k)$-puzzle has $s$ rows and $k$ columns.  The
columns are inherent ordered and indexed by $\ordset{k}$.  The rows are not
inherently ordered, however, it is often convienent to assume that the
rows are arbitrarily ordered and indexed by $\ordset{s}$.

\cite{cksu05} also establish a particular combinatorial property of
such puzzles that can derive groups that matrix multiplication can be
embedded into.  Such puzzles are called \emph{strong} uniquely
solvable puzzles.  However, to give some intuition we first explain a
simpler version of the property called \emph{uniquely solvable
  puzzles}.

\begin{definition}[Uniquely Solvable Puzzle (USP)]
  ~\\An $(s,k)$-puzzle $P$ is \emph{uniquely solvable} if
  $\forall \pi_0, \pi_1, \pi_2 \in \Sym{P}:$
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item either $\pi_0 = \pi_1 = \pi_2$, or
  \item $\exists r \in P, \exists i \in \ordset{k}$ such that at least two
    of the following hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\pi_0(r))_i = 0$,
    \item $(\pi_1(r))_i = 1$,
    \item $(\pi_2(r))_i = 2$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Informally a puzzle is \textbf{not} uniquely solvable if each row of
the puzzle can be broken into zeros, ones, and twos pieces and then
the rows can be reassembled in a different way so that each new row is
a combination of a zeroes, a ones, and twos piece where there is
exactly element of $\ordset{3}$ for each column.  Observe that uniquely
solvable puzzles can have at most $2^k$ rows because each zeroes
piece, ones piece, and two piece must be unique, as otherwise the
duplicate pieces can be swapped making the puzzle not uniquely
solvable.  The definition of \emph{strong} uniquely solvable puzzle is
below, it is nearly the same except that it requires that there be a
collision on a column between exactly two pieces, not two or more
pieces like in the original definition.

\begin{definition}[Strong Uniquely Solvable Puzzle]
  ~\\
  An $(s,k)$-puzzle $P$ is \emph{strong uniquely solvable} if
  $\forall \pi_0, \pi_1, \pi_2 \in \Sym{P}:$
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item either $\pi_0 = \pi_1 = \pi_2$, or
  \item $\exists r \in P, \exists i \in \ordset{k}$ such that exactly two
    of the following hold:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item $(\pi_0(r))_i = 0$,
    \item $(\pi_1(r))_i = 1$,
    \item $(\pi_2(r))_i = 2$.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
  
\end{definition}

Observe that the properties of uniquely solvable and strong uniquely
solvable are invariant to the ordering of the rows or columns of a
puzzle.  This fact is used implicitly.  Also note that these
properties are invariant to maps between puzzles induced by
permutations from \Sym{\ordset{3}} on the puzzle cell elements.

Cohn et al.~ show the following connection between the existence of
strong uniquely solvable puzzles and upper bounds on the exponent of
matrix multiplication $\omega$.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Corollary 3.6]{cksu05}}]
  If there is a strong uniquely solvable $(s,k)$-puzzle,
  $$\omega \le \min_{m \ge 3, m \in \Natural} \frac{3 \log
    m}{\log(m-1)} - \frac{3 \log s!}{sk \log(m-1)}.$$
\end{lemma}

In the same article, the authors also demonstrate the existence of an
infinite family of strong uniquely solvable puzzles that achieves a
non-trivial bound on $\omega$.

\begin{lemma}[{\cite[Proposition 3.8]{cksu05}}]
  There is an infinite family of strong uniquely solvable puzzles that
  achieves $\omega < 2.48$.
\end{lemma}

Finally, they conjecture that strong uniquely solvable puzzles provide
a root to achieving quadratic time matrix multiplication.

\begin{conjecture}[{\cite{cksu05}}]
  There exists a family of strong uniquely solvable puzzles that
  implies $\omega = 2$.
\end{conjecture}

Unfortunately, this conjecture was recently shown to be false.

\begin{lemma}[\cite{bccgu16}]
  Strong uniquely solvable puzzles cannot show $\omega < 2 +
  \epsilon$, for some $\epsilon > 0$.
\end{lemma}

This result is a consequence of a recent breakthrough arithmetic
progressions in cap sets \cite{e16,clp16} combined with a conditional
result on the Erd\"{o}s-Szemeredi sunflower conjecture \cite{asu13}.
The results of \cite{bccgu16} do imply that Cohn and Umans' strong
uniquely solvable puzzle approach cannot achieve the ideal $\omega =
2$.  However, we are unaware of a concrete lower bound on $\epsilon$
implies by this result.  This means there is a still a substantial gap
in our understanding between what has been acheived by the refinements
of LeGall, Williams, and Stothers, and the impossibility of showing
$\omega = 2$ using the Cohn and Umans' approach.
