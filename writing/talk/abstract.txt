Title: Computer-Aided Search for Matrix Multiplication Algorithms

Abstract: In 2005, Henry Cohn and Chris Umans proposed a framework for
developing matrix multiplication algorithms that could surpass the
O(n^{2.375}) run time of Coppersmith and Winograd's algorithm.  They
showed that the existence of certain algebraic structures, called
strong uniquely-solvable puzzles, that are sufficiently large imply
faster algorithms for matrix multiplication.  In my talk I'll begin by
describing the Cohn-Umans framework and then discuss our work
developing, implementing, and evaluating algorithms to generate large
strong uniquely-solvable puzzles.  I will discuss the litany of
greedy, dynamic programming, satisfiability, mixed-integer
programming, 3D matching, search, and parallel approaches that we used
to generate large uniquely-solvable puzzles.  I'll conclude by
reflecting on some of the lessons I've learned as a theorist trying to
use computers to aid in solving this computational complexity problem.

This is ongoing work with Zongliang Ji and Anthony Yang Xu, two
undergraduate students at Union College.
