    five to ten. Note that the legend in (a) applies to all six plots,
    and that the axes are named only the edge of the page.  Each plot
    describes the behavior of five algorithms brute force (BF),
    dynamic programming (DP), reduction to satisfiability (SAT),
    reduction to integer programming (IP), and the hybrid algorithm
    (HYB).  The final dashed line indicates the percentage of SUSP
    found among the 10000 random puzzles.}
