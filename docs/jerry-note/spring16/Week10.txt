Week 10

Read Chapter 2 & 3 for parallel programming

Edit a little bit of CheckUSP.c

Practicum goal that hasn't fullfilled:

1. how to interact with Union's Jupiter cluster (only log in for secs once)
2.  Write code to "construct" USP (only used example from the research paper)
3.  Didn't fully debugg the Test(checkUSP) algorithm
