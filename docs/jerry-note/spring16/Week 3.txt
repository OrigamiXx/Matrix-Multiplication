Read Chapter 5 and 6 roughly understand the array pointers and stucture 
by comparing to Java, but still have questions and don't understand why there
is this pointer thing must be implemented in the code in C.

Watch and read a lot of tutorials on how to build a linked list by using C. I understand how to
build a linked list.
First, create a node structure with data and next node in it.
Then declare a head node as a global variable. 

Then all the method (java) for linked list would be start with void
outside and before the main loop.

Main method is actually now the test file of the linked list in OO Java.

Due to limited time, I only had a simple linked list can only insert at head.
But I read much more than I coded.

Questions:
About pointers and structures.
The sign * & and ->.
Need a lesson on transfering from Java to C.
