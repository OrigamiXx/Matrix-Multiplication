<H3>MapReduce kv_stats() method 
</H3>
<H3>MapReduce kmv_stats() method

<H3>MapReduce cummulative_stats() method

<PRE>uint64_t MapReduce::kv_stats(int level)
uint64_t MapReduce::kmv_stats(int level)
void MapReduce::cummulative_stats(int level, int reset) 
</PRE>
<P>Calling the kv_stats() method prints statistics about the KeyValue
object stored within the MapReduce object.  The total number of
key/value pairs is returned.  If level = 0 is specified, nothing else
is done.  If level = 1 is specified, a one-line summary is printed for
all the key/value pairs across all processors.  If a level = 2 is
specified, per-processor information is also printed in a one-line
histogram format.
</P>
<P>Calling the kmv_stats() method prints statistics about the
KeyMultiValue object stored within the MapReduce object.  The total
number of key/multi-value pairs is returned.  If level = 0 is
specified, nothing else is done.  If level = 1 is specified, a
one-line summary is printed for all the key/multi-value pairs across
all processors.  If a level = 2 is specified, per-processor
information is also printed in a one-line histogram format.
</P>
<P>Calling the cummulative_stats() method prints statistics about the
cummulative memory allocation, inter-processor communication volume,
and file I/O volume that has been performed by all MapReduce
operations up to this point, by all MapReduce objects your program has
instantiated.  If level = 1 is specified, a brief summary is printed.
If level = 2 is specified, per-processor information is also printed
in a one-line histogram format.
</P>
<P>If the <I>reset</I> flag is set to 1, then the counters for these
quantities are reset to 0.
</P>
<P>This cummulative_stats() method is called internally when your program
destructs the last MapReduce object, using the
<A HREF = "settings.html">verbosity</A> setting for the level argument.  If
verbosity is set to 0, then the method is not called.
