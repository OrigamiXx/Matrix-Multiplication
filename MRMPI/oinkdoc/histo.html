<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>histo -i in1 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>in1 = anthing: Key = key, Value = value
<LI>out1 = frequency count of each key: Key = key, Value = count 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>histo -i mrdata -o NULL out1.mr 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which calculates the frequency of key occurrence
in an input set of key/values.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 is any MR-MPI object containing key/value pairs.  The input is
unchanged by this command.
</P>
<P>In1 cannot be specified as input from file(s) since no assumption is
made about how the files store key/value pairs.  You would need to
read the files into a MR-MPI object as a pre-processing step, using a
map() function you provide, before passing that object to the histo
command as an input.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the frequency count of all unique keys.
</P>
<P>Out1 cannot be specified as output to a file since no assumption is
made about how the key should be formatted for output.  You would need
to write the files from the output MR-MPI object as a post-processing
step, using a map() or scan() function you provide.
</P>
<P>Statistics on the count of each key will be printed to the screen in
sorted order.
