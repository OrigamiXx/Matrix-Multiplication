<H3>neigh_tri command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>neigh_tri dirname -i input1 input2 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>dirname = directory name to create set of output files in, one per vertex
<LI>input1 = graph neighbors: Key = Vi, Value = Vj Vk ...
<LI>input2 = triangles: Key = Vi Vj Vk, Value = NULL
<LI>out1 = neighbors + triangle edges of each vertex: Key = Vi, MultiValue = Vj Vk ... (Vj Vk) (Vm Vn) ... 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>neigh_tri myneigh -i mrn mrtri -o NULL mrnplus
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which calculates a list of edges associated
with each vertex in an undirected graph, which include all edges the
vertex is in (its first neighbors) and also edges between pairs of its
first neighbors (triangle edges).  This set of data is written to a
file per vertex as a list of edges.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>Input1 stores a set of neighbors of each vertex.  See the
<A HREF = "neighbor.html">neighbor</A> command, which can compute this data.  Input2
stores a set of triangles.  See the <A HREF = "tri_find.html">tri_find</A> command,
which can compute this data.  The two inputs are unchanged by this
command.
</P>
<P>These 2 data sets are merged to identify the edges that exist between
pairs of neighbors of each vertex.  This information is written to a
file per vertex.  The name of each file is dirname/Vi where <I>dirname</I>
is the specified argument (a directory name), and Vi is the vertex ID.
Each file will contain a list of edges, one per line, written as Vm
Vn.  For some of the Vm will equal Vi, which means they are edges
containing Vi, i.e. they are the first neighbors of Vi.  Other edges
will have Vm != Vi.  These are edges between pairs of first neighbors.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the neighbor and triangle edge information as
key/multivalue (KMV) pairs, not as key/value (KV) pairs (the usual
form of output).
</P>
<P>Out1.file must be specified as NULL with the "-o" argument so that the
output is only allowed as an MR-MPI object, not as a file.  This is
because the file would contain data for all the vertices together.
The equivalent info is already output as one file per vertex, as
described above.
</P>
<P>NOTE: alter the neigh_tri.cpp code so that it uses the input dirname
with expandpath() to apply the global prepend and substitute settings ??
