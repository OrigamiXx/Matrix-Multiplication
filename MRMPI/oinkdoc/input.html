<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command is used to control the reading of input data that a
<A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> performs as part of its input.  It does
this by setting options on specific inputs to <A HREF = "command.html">named
commands</A>.  The options set by this command are in effect
for ONLY the next named commmand.  After a named command is invoked,
it restores all input options to their default values.  Note that all
of the options which can be set by this command have default values,
so you don't need to set those you don't want to change.
</P>
<P>As described on the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page, a named
command may specify one or more input descriptors.  If the descriptor
is one or more file or directory names, then each of them is converted
into a list of strings which is passed to a map() method of a created
MR-MPI object, along with various other arguments needed by the map()
method.  The purpose of the input command is to give you control over
how that conversion takes place and what the values of those
additional arguments are.
</P>
<P>The <I>N</I> value corresponds to a particular input descriptor, as defined
by the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.  It should be an integer from 1
to Ninput, where Ninput is the number of input descriptors the command
requires.  The input command can be used multiple times with the same
<I>N</I> to specify different parameters, e.g. one at a time.
</P>
<P>The remaining arguments are pairs of <I>keywords</I> and <I>values</I>.  One
or more can be specified.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>prepend</I>, <I>substitute</I>, and <I>multi</I> keywords alter
the file and directory path names specified with an input descriptor
in a named command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>prepend</I>, <I>substitute</I>, and <I>multi</I> keywords are
applied to each file of directory name in the list of such names that
the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> uses in its input descriptor.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: The <I>prepend</I> and <I>substitute</I> keywords can also be
set globally so that their values will be applied to all input
descriptors of all <A HREF = "command.html">named commands</A>.  See the
<A HREF = "set.html">set</A> command for details.  If an input command is not used
to override the global value, then the global value is used by the
<A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.
</P>
<P>The <I>prepend</I> keyword specifies a path name to prepend to each input
file or directory name specified with the <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A>. The prepend string is presumed to be a
directory name and should be specified without the trailing "/"
character, since that is added when the prepending is done.
</P>
<P>Input file or directory names specified with the <A HREF = "command.html">named
command</A> can contain either or both of two wildcard
characters: "%" or "*".  Only the first occurrence of each wildcard
character is replaced.
</P>
<P>If the <I>substitute</I> keyword is set to 0, then a "%" is replaced by the
processor ID, 0 to Nprocs-1.  If it is set to N > 0, then "%" is
replaced by (proc-ID % N) + 1.  I.e. for 8 processors and N = 4, then
the 8 processors replace the "%" with (1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4).  This can be
useful for multi-core nodes where each core has its own local disk.
E.g. you wish each core to read data from one disk.
</P>
<P>If a "*" appears, then the file or directory name is duplicated N
times where N is the value set by the <I>multi</I> keyword.  In each of the
N duplicates, the "*" is replaced by the number 1 to N.  Again, this
can be useful for multi-core nodes where each core has its own local
disk.  E.g. you want a single core to read data from each of several
local disks on the node, presumably because you have launched an MPI
job so that it runs on a single core per node.
</P>
<HR>

<P>The <I>mmode</I> keyword stands for "map mode" and determines what form of
the <A HREF = "../doc/map.html">MR-MPI library map() method</A> is invoked by the
<A HREF = "command.html">named command</A>.  It is up to the coding of the "named
command" to determine which of these forms of data input it supports.
There are 3 variants of the map() method which involve file input:
</P>
<PRE>mmode = 0 = map(int nstr, char **strings, int self, int recurse, int readfile, void (*mymap)(), void *ptr)
mmode = 1 = map(int nmap, int nstr, char **strings, int recurse, int readfile, char sepchar, int delta, void (*mymap)(), void *ptr)
mmode = 2 = map(int nmap, int nstr, char **strings, int recurse, int
readfile, char *sepstr, int delta, void (*mymap)(), void *ptr) 
</PRE>
<P>The "nstr" and "strings" arguments to these methods are created by
OINK, using the settings described above.  The remaining arguments are
set by the keywords of the input command, as needed.  Note that some
keywords have no meaning for certain map() method variants, in which
case they are simply ignored.
</P>
<P>The meaning of the <I>self</I>, <I>recurse</I>, <I>readfile</I>, <I>nmap</I>, <I>sepchar</I>,
<I>sepstr</I>, and <I>delta</I> keywords is the same as explained on the doc
page for the <A HREF = "../doc/map.html">map() method</A> of the MR-MPI library.
The value for the <I>sepchar</I> keyword will be treated as a single
character.  The value for the <I>sepstr</I> keyword will be treated as a
string.
