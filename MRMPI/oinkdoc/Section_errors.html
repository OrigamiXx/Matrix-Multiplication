<H3>5. Errors 
</H3>
<P>OINK tries to flag errors and print informative error messages so you
can fix the problem.
</P>
<P>If you get an error message about an invalid command in your input
script, you can determine what command is causing the problem by
looking in the log.oink file or using the <A HREF = "echo.html">echo command</A>
to see it on the screen.  For a given command, OINK expects certain
arguments in a specified order.  If you mess this up, OINK will
often flag the error.
</P>
<P>Generally, OINK will print a message to the screen and logfile and
exit gracefully when it encounters a fatal error.  Sometimes it will
print a WARNING to the screen and logfile and continue on; you can
decide if the WARNING is important or not.  If OINK crashes or hangs
without spitting out an error message first then it could be a bug
</P>
<P>If you think you have found a bug in OINK, please send an email to the
<A HREF = "http://mapreduce.sandia.gov">developers</A> with info
about the problem.  Anything you can do to isolate the problem and
reproduce it on a small data set will be helpful.
</P>

<H4><A NAME = "5_1"></A>5.1 Error & warning messages 
</H4>
<P>These are two alphabetic lists of the <A HREF = "#error">ERROR</A> and
<A HREF = "#warn">WARNING</A> messages OINK prints out and the reason why.  If the
explanation here is not sufficient, the documentation for the
offending command may help.  Grepping the source files for the text of
the error message and staring at the source code and comments is also
not a bad idea!  Note that sometimes the same message can be printed
from multiple places in the code.
