<H3>neighbor command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>neighbor -i in1 -o out1.file out1.mr 
</PRE>
<UL><LI>in1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
<LI>out1 = neighbors of each vertex: Key = Vi, Value = Vj Vk ... 
</UL>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<P>degree -i mrv -o degree.list NULL
</P>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which calculates the list of neighbors of each
vertex in an undirected graph.  A list of all the vertices each vertex
shares an edge with is calculated.  These are the first neighbors of
each vertex.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges, assumed to have no duplicates or
self-edges.  This means that either (Vi,Vj) or (Vj,Vi) appears, but
not both.  Also (Vi,Vi) does not appear.  The input is unchanged by
this command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the list of neighbor vertices for each vertex.  The
list is a single value in a key/value pair which is a vector of vertex
IDs, one after the other.
