<P>This command deletes all data structures and restores all settings to
their default values.  Once a clear command has been executed, it is
as if OINK were starting over, with only the exceptions noted below.
This command enables multiple jobs to be run sequentially from one
input script.
</P>
<P>These settings are not affected by a clear command: the working
directory (<A HREF = "shell.html">shell</A> command), log file status
(<A HREF = "log.html">log</A> command), echo status (<A HREF = "echo.html">echo</A> command), and
input script variables (<A HREF = "variable.html">variable</A> command).
