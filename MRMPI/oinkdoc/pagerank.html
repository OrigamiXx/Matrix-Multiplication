<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which computes the PageRank numeric score for
vertices in a directed graph.  The PageRank of a vertex is a measure
of how "important" it is in the graph, based on what vertices point to
it, and the PageRank of those vertices.  If the graph represents WWW
pages linked to each other, then this is part of how Google ranks the
relative importance of pages it shows you as the result of a search.
See <A HREF = "#Google">this Google site</A> for more information.
</P>
<P>The PageRank calculation is performed via an iterative matrix-vector
multiply operation, where the graph can be though of as a sparse
matrix.  The MapReduce version of this PageRank implementation is
described in the paper of <A HREF = "#Plimpton">(Plimpton)</A>.
</P>
<P>Describe what alpha and tolerance and maxiter do.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in which
the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges with weights, assumed to have no duplicates,
meaning that (Vi,Vj) only appears once.  Each edge is directed in the
sense that Vi points to Vj.  The weight is effectively the non-zero
value of the (Vi,Vj) element of the matrix.  Typically it should be
1/D where D is the out-degree of Vi, but this is not required.  The
input is unchanged by this command.
</P>
<P>Out1 will store the list of vertices and the numeric rank of each
vertex.
