<H3>degree_stats command 
</H3>
<P><B>Syntax:</B>
</P>
<PRE>degree_stats dupflag -i in1 
</PRE>
<P>dupflag = 1/2 for counting edge once/twice
in1 = graph edges: Key = Vi Vj, Value = NULL
</P>
<P><B>Examples:</B>
</P>
<PRE>degree_stats 2 -i edges 
</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This is a named command which calculates and prints out the degree
statistics of an undirected graph.  For each degree d, one line is
printed to the screen with the number of vertices of degree d.  This
is done in sorted order.
</P>
<P>If the dupflag is 2, then each edge increments the degree of both of
its vertices.  If the dupflag is 1, then each edge only increments the
degree of the first of its vertices.  The former is usually more
approrpriate for undirected graphs; the latter for directed graphs, in
which case the out-degree of each vertex is being calculated.  The
latter can also be useful if the graph represents a sparse matrix and
you want the statistics on non-zeroes in each row of the matrix.
</P>
<P>See the <A HREF = "command.html">named command</A> doc page for various ways in
which the -i inputs and -o outputs for a named command can be
specified.
</P>
<P>In1 stores a set of edges.  No assumption is made about duplicates or
self edges, i.e. (Vi,Vj) may appear multiple times, both (Vi,Vj) or
(Vj,Vi) may appear, as may (Vi,Vi).  The input is unchanged by this
command.
</P>
<P>This command produces no output.
</P>
<P>Statistics on the degree count of each vertex will be printed to the
screen in sorted order.
