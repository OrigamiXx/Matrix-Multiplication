This directory contains Python code which wraps MR-MPI as a library
and allows the MR-MPI library interface to be invoked from Python,
either from a script or interactively.

Details on the Python interface to MR-MPI and how to build MR-MPI as a
shared library, for use with Python, are given in
doc/Interface_python.html and in doc/Start.html.

Basically you need to follow these steps in the src directory:

% make -f Makefile.shlib g++    # or whatever machine target you wish
% make install-python           # may need to do this via sudo

You can replace the last step with running the python/install.py
script directly to give you more control over where two relevant files
are installed, or by setting environment variables in your shell
script.  See doc/Interface_python.html for details.

You can then launch Python and instantiate an instance of MR-MPI:

% python
>>> from mrmpi import mrmpi
>>> mr = mrmpi()

If that gives no errors, you have succesfully wrapped MR-MPI with
Python.  You should then be able to run the Python scripts in the
examples sub-directory.
